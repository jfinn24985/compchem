<!--                    Note: The relationship between a compound
                        and a program is uni-directional. Ideally a 
                        compound may belong to several programs (with
                        comp-src includes). The compound itself
                        does not need to know the name of the

             category   A set of category IDs that allow formulae to
                        be grouped in meaningful ways.  Order is not
                        important, though priority can be flagged by
                        ending an ID with the ":" and a number (lower
                        number is higher priority).  For example if
                        you are studying a reaction with several
                        steps you would identify each step with an
                        ID, and if you are making a comparison across
                        substituents then they could be IDed.  It
                        would then be possible for a report to
                        generate a table of reaction v. substituent.
