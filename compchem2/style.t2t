The coding style follows astyle with config file:
style=ansi
indent=spaces=2

The older alternative is gnu indent. The following is similar to the
astyle above, however indent doesn't handle C++ syntax very
well.
 indent -bli0 -l0
in vim
 %!indent -bli0 -nut -l0 - -o -

Note that gnu indent uses the GNU coding style by default.
